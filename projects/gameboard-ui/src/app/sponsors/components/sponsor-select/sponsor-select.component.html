        To play challenges on {{ appName }} you'll need to select your sponsoring organization. Their logo will
        appear next to your name on scoreboards.

    <p>
        Some sponsors house other sponsors within them (e.g. the Department of Homeland Security contains the
        Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency). If you're sponsored by one of these entities, you're free to
        name either the Department or your specific branch as your sponsor.
