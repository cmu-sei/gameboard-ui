        This game allows {{ normalSessionLengthDescription }} to play. Since there's less time remaining than that
        until the game ends ({{ gameEndDateDescription }}), you're unable to start a session.
    </alert>

    <alert type="warning" class="p-4" *ngIf="gameAllowsLateStart">
        <strong>NOTE: </strong> This game's availability period ends at
        <strong>{{gameEndDateDescription}}</strong>. If you start a session now, you'll have about
        <strong>{{(gameEndDateTime || null) | untilDateTime}}</strong> to complete the challenges. This is less than the
        full allotment of time ({{normalSessionLengthDescription}}) for a session. If
        you continue, your session will end when the game does.
