            <h2>A new look for Reports!</h2>

            <p>
                Welcome, internal SEI testers! We're deep into the process of revamping Gameboard's reporting
                capabilities.
                We plan for this new reporting module to ultimately replace the old reports (found in
                <a [routerLink]="['/admin/report']">Admin</a>).
            </p>

            <p>
                However, we still have work to do, so we welcome your help! If you experience a bug not listed in the
                "Known issues" panel below, message Ben on your choice of Mattermost or Teams at your convenience to
                describe it. Additionally, if you have feedback about the usability or user experience of these reports,
                feel free to voice those. Some of these are subject to review from CISA, but we'll evaluate all feedback
                -
                we want this to continue to improve on the prior reporting system and address needs as they emerge.
                Thanks for your support!
            </p>

                We're aware of several issues with the current build of this screen and are addressing them as
                efficiently
                possible. If you experience an issue NOT listed here, please let us know!

                    The <strong>paging controls</strong> at the bottom of each report are currently not correctly
                    paging the results. Until this is resolved, use filter controls to find the results you're
                    interested.
                    This is our current highest priority.

                    <strong>Filter controls</strong> do not reflect their currently selected values if you open a
                    link to the reports page which includes filtering. For example,
                    <a [routerLink]="['/reports/enrollment']" [queryParams]="{ track: 'Track A' }">
                        this link
                    </a>
                    should open to the Enrollment Report with Track A selected, and it will display results correctly.
                    However, the track filter does not show that Track A is selected.
